                        <p>
                            Having served as a manager at Biggby Coffee, I mastered leadership and operational efficiency while fostering a 
                            collaborative team environment. Simultaneously, my engineering internship equipped me with technical skills, 
                            problem-solving abilities, and project management expertise. This blend of managerial experience and engineering 
                            acumen enables me to approach challenges with a versatile skill set and innovative solutions.  In addition I have 
                            continued my studies into computer science at Saginaw Valley State University and wish to gain further experience 
                            in a professional work setting.

                    <p>Here is an example testimonial I made for this assigment: "Working with Samuel has been a remarkable experience. His leadership at Biggby Coffee was nothing short of transformative—he consistently fostered 
                        a collaborative team culture while maintaining operational excellence under pressure. What truly sets Samuel apart is his ability to bridge managerial insight with 
                        technical acumen. During his engineering internship at Lapeer Plating and Plastic, he demonstrated a keen eye for process optimization and even contributed to building a 
                        custom database application that improved departmental efficiency. His ongoing studies in computer science at Saginaw Valley State University reflect his commitment 
                        to growth, and his proficiency in web development and programming languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript make him a versatile asset. Samuel brings a rare blend of 
                        initiative, problem-solving, and professionalism to every environment he enters."
